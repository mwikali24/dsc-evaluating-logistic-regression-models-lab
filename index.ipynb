{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["# Evaluating Logistic Regression Models - Lab\n","\n","## Introduction\n","\n","In regression, you are predicting continuous values so it makes sense to discuss error as a distance of how far off our estimates were. When classifying a binary variable, however, a model is either correct or incorrect. As a result, we tend to quantify this in terms of how many false positives versus false negatives we come across. In particular, we examine a few different specific measurements when evaluating the performance of a classification algorithm. In this lab, you'll review precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 score in order to evaluate our logistic regression models.\n","\n","\n","## Objectives \n","\n","In this lab you will: \n","\n","- Implement evaluation metrics from scratch using Python \n","\n","\n","\n","## Terminology review  \n","\n","Let's take a moment and review some classification evaluation metrics:  \n","\n","\n","$$ \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Number of Predicted Positives}} $$    \n","\n","$$ \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives}}{\\text{Number of Actual Total Positives}} $$  \n","  \n","$$ \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{Number of True Positives + True Negatives}}{\\text{Total Observations}} $$\n","\n","$$ \\text{F1 score} = 2 * \\frac{\\text{Precision * Recall}}{\\text{Precision + Recall}} $$\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["At times, it may be best to tune a classification algorithm to optimize against precision or recall rather than overall accuracy. For example, imagine the scenario of predicting whether or not a patient is at risk for cancer and should be brought in for additional testing. In cases such as this, we often may want to cast a slightly wider net, and it is preferable to optimize for recall, the number of cancer positive cases, than it is to optimize precision, the percentage of our predicted cancer-risk patients who are indeed positive."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## Split the data into training and test sets"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>age</th>\n","      <th>sex</th>\n","      <th>cp</th>\n","      <th>trestbps</th>\n","      <th>chol</th>\n","      <th>fbs</th>\n","      <th>restecg</th>\n","      <th>thalach</th>\n","      <th>exang</th>\n","      <th>oldpeak</th>\n","      <th>slope</th>\n","      <th>ca</th>\n","      <th>thal</th>\n","      <th>target</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>63</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>145</td>\n","      <td>233</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>150</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2.3</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>37</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>130</td>\n","      <td>250</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>187</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>3.5</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>41</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>130</td>\n","      <td>204</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>172</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1.4</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>56</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>120</td>\n","      <td>236</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>178</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0.8</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>57</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>120</td>\n","      <td>354</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>163</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","      <td>0.6</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>0</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>1</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["   age  sex  cp  trestbps  chol  fbs  restecg  thalach  exang  oldpeak  slope  \\\n","0   63    1   3       145   233    1        0      150      0      2.3      0   \n","1   37    1   2       130   250    0        1      187      0      3.5      0   \n","2   41    0   1       130   204    0        0      172      0      1.4      2   \n","3   56    1   1       120   236    0        1      178      0      0.8      2   \n","4   57    0   0       120   354    0        1      163      1      0.6      2   \n","\n","   ca  thal  target  \n","0   0     1       1  \n","1   0     2       1  \n","2   0     2       1  \n","3   0     2       1  \n","4   0     2       1  "]},"execution_count":15,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","df = pd.read_csv('heart.csv')\n","df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Split the data first into `X` and `y`, and then into training and test sets.
